- Module system
  - Like in JS, imports and re-exports should be separate: You can't re-export without importing
  - Imports and re-exports don't need a visibility
  - `::{self}` shouldn't make a difference
  - `foo.rs` vs `foo/mod.rs` is cursed
  - don't require module declarations in the parent module, write `pub mod;` (with docs) at the top
- Enums
  - variants/fields are public, unlike everything else
  - Variants should be types
- `macro_rules`
  - Should use item scoping and allow a visibility modifier
  - Parsing is awkward
- Patterns
  - `let` should be part of the binding, not the declaration construct
  - no difference between `_ =` and `let _ =`
  - lowercase constants can be confused with bindings
  - `..` is a wildcard in a tuple or slice pattern, but `..n` is a half-open range
- Operators
  - Bitwise operators are rarely needed, could be removed
  - `wrapping_*`, `saturating_*`, `strict_*`, `exact_*`, `overflowing_*`, `carrying_*`, `widening_*`, `borrowing_*`, `checked_*`, `unchecked_*` functions don't have operators
- Effects
  - `const fn` should be the default; non-const functions need an `io` effect or similar
  - `async fn` should be an effect
- General
  - Regular structs should use parentheses: `struct Foo(x: i32, y: i32)`
    - this also removes a syntactic ambiguity: `if a == X {} {}`
  - `matches!` is a band aid -> need `is` operator
  - multi-line strings don't strip indentation
